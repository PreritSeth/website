Project Website
=======

The first large project I intend on completing through GitHub is constructing my personal website. This website will allow me to
showcase details regarding myself such as skills, exeperience, and interests in order to make it easier for people to connect 
and collaborate with me. This will also serve as my first experience using GitHub servers.
